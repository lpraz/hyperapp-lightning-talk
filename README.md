# hyperapp-lightning-talk
Demo app created for my talk at Full Stack MB's ["A Night of Lightning"](https://www.meetup.com/fullstackmb/events/266689228/) at the Brandon Public Library on 2019/12/09.

## Running
As Hyperapp comes in through a CDN, you won't need a build step, only need an HTTP server that serves static files. I recommend [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) for running locally.
